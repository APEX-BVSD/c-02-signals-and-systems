# Signals and Systems

> ** Remove the instructions in block quotes before you submit **

> Design, build, program, and test a signaling system that communicates useful information without a screen or speaker. The red, yellow, and green LEDs 
> automatically cycle through your planned states; no push button is needed. Complete this README as you work. Keep your planning, testing evidence, and 
> link to your video demo here.

## 1. System purpose

- **Problem and real-world context:** TODO
- **Intended user:** TODO
- **What information should your signals communicate?** TODO
- **How does the user interpret and use that information?** TODO

## 2. State table and pattern plan

> Use the launch activity's approach: interpret a pattern, identify its states, and explain its meaning. Plan at least three meaningful message states. A 
> message may use several rows, such as a blinking pattern.

> Record a new row whenever any LED changes. Use ON/OFF and durations in milliseconds (1,000 ms = 1 second). Add or remove rows as needed. The last row > returns to the first automatically.

| Step | State/message name | LED Color | LED Color | LED Color | Duration (ms) | Meaning to the user |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| 2 | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| 3 | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

**Sequence:** TODO → TODO → TODO → repeat  

## 3. Circuit design

> Design your layout in TinkerCAD.
> Export an image and upload it to this repo. Link it below

### Ohm's law calculations

> Use `R = (V_output - V_LED) / I` to estimate the resistance for each LED. Use volts, amperes, and ohms; convert milliamperes to amperes. 
> . Choose a suitable available resistor and check the resulting current using `I = (V_output - V_LED) / R`.

| LED | Arduino output voltage (V) | LED voltage drop (V) | Calculated resistor voltage (V) | Target current (A) | Calculated resistance (Ω) | Chosen resistance (Ω) | Estimated actual current (A) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color LED | 5.0 | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| Color LED | 5.0 | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| Color LED | 5.0 | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## 4. Testing and revision
> Test your system with two people outside our class. Show each person the complete sequence before explaining its intended meaning. Ask:
> What do you think this system is communicating? Describe what each light pattern means to you.
> Were any patterns confusing or difficult to tell apart? Explain which ones and why.
> What would make the signals easier to understand? Consider the colors, combinations, blinking, or timing.

**Person 1:** TODO

**Person 2:** TODO

**Did their interpretations match your intended meaning? Explain:** TODO

**Revisions made to the system based on feedback**
> Describe at least one revisions you made based on the feedback you received and TEST it again.
**Revision and reason**:

**Result after testing the revision:**

## 5. Video Demonstration
> Replace the placeholder below with a link to your video. Demonstrate the complete repeating sequence and explain what each signal communicates. Make sure > your instructor can access the video.
